    "In the Data Science Capstone course, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to examine and cluster venues in areas of Toronto, Ontario with a Borough name that included the word 'Toronto'. Six boroughs were identified and neighborhoods within each of those boroughs were examined. The analysis revealed the most popular venues within the neighborhoods of those six boroughs. \n",

    "This report will expand on that analysis to examine the most popular types of restaurants in all boroughs in Toronto, Ontario. The analysis will provide venue information from the Foursquare location data tool to identify the most popular restaurants and their food types in each neighborhood in Toronto. This information can be used by tourists, visitors, or individuals who are new to the city to identify the most popular restaurants in each neighborhood by type of food. This information could also be used by individuals who are considering opening a new restaurant of a specific type to identify where that type of food is most popular in Toronto or where fewer restaurants of that type or located, which may be a good opportunity for business development in less crowded areas.\n",
